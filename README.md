## Scikit-Learn Tutorial: Python Machine Learning
This scikit-learn tutorial for beginners was published on the DataCamp Community on the 3rd of January. 
You can find it here: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-python. 

The tutorial was written with the use of R Markdown in combination with [DataCamp Light](https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp-light) and [Pythonwhat](https://github.com/datacamp/pythonwhat). The tutorial is built up around the steps that one needs to go through in order to elaborate a machine learning project with Python. In this case, it departs from one of the built-in data sets in scikit-learn, namely, digits, but the option of downloading the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is also discussed. Several models are visualized with matplotlib and evaluated with the appropriate scikit-learn modules in this tutorial and pointers for further machine learning/data science projects are also included.
